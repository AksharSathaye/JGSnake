//The only reason why I'm using the inferior spelling of "colour" is because SFML unfortunately also uses it. Consistency!
// This file MAY in the future be used to hold all the colours of all the assets in one file, 
// Or maybe a function that can set some of these colours (eg. snake colour) depending on user prefs.
